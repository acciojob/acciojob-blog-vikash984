	<p>We can say that optimization is the process of improving a solution to make it 
		more efficient in terms of time, space, or other resources, while brute force 
		involves trying all possible solutions without regard to efficiency. While brute
		force can guarantee a correct result by exploring every option, it often becomes 
		impractical for large or complex problems. Optimization, on the other hand, uses 
		smart strategies to reduce the search space and find a good or even the best solution
		faster, making it essential for solving real-world problems effectively.</p><br><br>

		DSA vs. Competitive Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of problem-solving in computer science, providing the tools and techniques needed to write efficient code. Competitive programming, on the other hand, is a timed activity where participants use DSA concepts to solve challenging problems under constraints. While DSA focuses on understanding how algorithms work and how data can be organized and manipulated, competitive programming emphasizes speed, accuracy, and the ability to apply DSA knowledge quickly in a competitive setting.
